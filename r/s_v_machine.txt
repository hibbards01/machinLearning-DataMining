When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?

I tried changing the gamma and the cost variables.
99.66% with:
gamma = 0.1
cost = 100

2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What
was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?

I tried changing the gamma and the cost variables.
97.25% with:
gamma = 0.1
cost = 20

3. Please describe your experiment/results for the Abalone dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?

I tried changing the gamma and the cost variables.
28.25%
gamma = 0.1
cost = 10

4. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.
I tried to make the code more dynamic but I did not know how to create a symoblic variable.


5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but signficantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

D.

6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I really went for the requirements. I tried to make it dynamic but I ran into some problems with the symbolic variable.
